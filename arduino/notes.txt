uno I have does have the problem with linux where if it is sending
constantly serial output (like reading a sensor) then it no longer
responds to IDE.

does respond to the "hold reset button" workaround.

finally got stuck with hold reset;

executed procedure here:

http://arduino.cc/en/Hacking/DFUProgramming8U2

with firmware;

seems now to be working ok.
