got basic manual dc motor working;

then hooked up to photo resistor.

single motor, and resistor.

next:   two!

done: two!

initial finding:
direct drive of wheels does not work with small motors:

they spin too fast and have no torque.

needed to dig into the pile of gears, and create a "step down" set of
gears to drive wheels.

since using "found" parts, not a kit...

not all the parts are identical...


find that one motor/gear setup runs faster...

now need to compensate in software...
